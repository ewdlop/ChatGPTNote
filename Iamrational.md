To encourage a large language model (LLM) to provide **direct, realistic, and useful responses**, you can use specific techniques to improve the clarity and relevance of its output. Here are strategies to "tell an LLM to get real":

---

### **1. Be Explicit About the Desired Style**
State clearly that you want realistic, no-nonsense responses. For example:
- **Prompt Example**: "Give me a practical explanation without unnecessary elaboration or metaphors."
- **Effect**: This sets the tone, so the model avoids overly creative or speculative answers.

---

### **2. Use Constraints**
Define parameters for the model's response:
- **Example**: "Answer in 2-3 sentences with actionable steps."
- **Why It Works**: The LLM will focus on concise and relevant information instead of veering into hypotheticals.

---

### **3. Call Out Specific Behaviors**
Let the LLM know when it’s being too vague or abstract:
- **Prompt**: "Avoid abstract theories and focus on practical applications."
- **Impact**: Encourages the model to ground its response in reality.

---

### **4. Use "Real-World Context" Requests**
Ask the model to relate answers to practical or real-world scenarios:
- **Example**: "Explain how this works in a real-world context."
- **Effect**: Guides the model to provide more tangible and relatable examples.

---

### **5. Reframe the Question**
If the response isn't grounded enough, rephrase your input to emphasize the need for clarity:
- **Before**: "Explain how databases work."
- **After**: "Explain how a MySQL database stores and retrieves data in plain terms, like how it’s used in e-commerce websites."

---

### **6. Request Evidence or Examples**
Ask for concrete examples or references:
- **Prompt**: "Provide a real-world example of this concept."
- **Effect**: Forces the LLM to link its answer to specific, realistic scenarios.

---

### **7. Limit Speculative Language**
Specify that the response should not include hypotheticals:
- **Prompt**: "Don't include 'maybe,' 'could be,' or other speculative language. Give definitive answers where possible."

---

### **8. Use Follow-Ups**
If the initial response is not grounded, follow up with:
- "Can you clarify this with a real-world example?"  
- "That’s vague—give me something actionable or concrete."

---

### **9. Set a Persona**
Tell the LLM to assume a specific role:
- **Example**: "Answer this as a software engineer with 5 years of experience who has worked on real-world systems."
- **Why It Works**: Setting a professional persona encourages realistic and grounded answers.

---

### **10. Ask for Step-by-Step Explanations**
Guide the response structure to focus on actionable information:
- **Prompt**: "Explain step-by-step how to set up a database using MySQL in a real-world project."
- **Effect**: The LLM will prioritize process over theory.

---

### **Example: Generic vs. Grounded**
#### Generic Prompt:
"Explain how a database works."
- **Response**: "A database is a system for storing and retrieving data. It uses tables and queries to organize and access information efficiently."

#### Grounded Prompt:
"Explain how an e-commerce site uses a MySQL database to manage orders."
- **Response**: "An e-commerce site uses a MySQL database to store order details in a table. Each order includes columns for the customer ID, product ID, quantity, and timestamp. When a customer places an order, a query inserts this data into the table, and another query retrieves the data for reports or customer service."

---

### **Key Takeaway**
To get "real" responses from an LLM:
1. Be explicit about tone and style.
2. Use real-world contexts and examples.
3. Avoid abstract or speculative requests.
4. Follow up if necessary for more grounded answers.
